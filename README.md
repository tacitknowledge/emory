Emory
=====

The Emory gem listens to file modifications and runs an action against it (for example, upload to a remote location).

<a name="requirements" />
Requirements
------------

Currently Emory requires Ruby 1.9.3. Work is underway to support 1.8.7
as well as JRuby.

<a name="installation" />
Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'emory'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install emory
```

<a name="usage" />
Usage
-----

Emory is run from the command line. Please open your terminal and go to your project's work directory.

There you would need to create Emory config file `.emory` which in fact is nothing more than regular
Ruby code wrapped in gem's configuration DSL.

Example configuration:

```ruby
require 'emory/handlers/stdout_handler'

handler do
  name :listener
  implementation Emory::Handlers::StdoutHandler
  events :all
end

teleport do
  path '~/_emory-test/'
  handler :listener
  ignore %r{ignored/}
  filter /\.txt$/
end
```

The gem supplies an executable file which scans for the configuration file in current directory
(and up the path if not found), configures itself and launches the process. If you need to terminate
execution then proceed like your operating system allows you to (Ctrl-C, for example).

```bash
$ emory
[2012-05-31 12:08:23] INFO  Emory::ConfigurationFile: Found config file: /Users/xxx/.emory
[2012-05-31 12:08:23] INFO  Emory::Runner: Watching directory: /Users/xxx/_emory-test
```

Emory outputs some information into the console where it was launched from. However if you would
like to consult more detailed information on what it's doing then feel free to supply `-d` or
`--debug` when launching it like in this example:

```bash
$ emory --debug
[2012-05-31 12:08:29] DEBUG Emory::Runner: Looking for the configuration file
[2012-05-31 12:08:29] DEBUG Emory::ConfigurationFile: Examining directory: /Users/xxx/Projects
[2012-05-31 12:08:29] DEBUG Emory::ConfigurationFile: Examining directory: /Users/xxx
[2012-05-31 12:08:29] INFO  Emory::ConfigurationFile: Found config file: /Users/xxx/.emory
[2012-05-31 12:08:29] DEBUG Emory::Runner: Reading configuration file contents
[2012-05-31 12:08:29] DEBUG Emory::Runner: Evaluating configuration file contents:
<<< the rest of the output is ommitted >>>
```

Emory configuration DSL
-----------------------

The Emory configuration DSL is evaluated as plain Ruby, so you can use normal Ruby code in your
`.emory` file. Emory itself provides the following DSL methods that can be used for configuration:

<a name="emory-dsl-handler" />
### handler

A handler in Emory is an entity which knows how to react on file system modification events.
By default only two are provided:

- `Emory::Handlers::AbstractHandler` - defines common interface for other handlers to implement
- `Emory::Handlers::StdoutHandler` - spits out some information on what/how changed to the standard output

A handler can be configured with 3 mandatory and 1 optional parameter:

- mandatory
    - name - defines a name for the handler so that it could be used in other parts of the configuration
    - implementation - name of the specific class that conforms to `Emory::Handlers::AbstractHandler`'s interface
    - events - a comma separated list of events the handler should react to (**:added**,
    **:modified**, **:removed**) while ignoring the ones not mentioned. There's also an **:all**
    shortcut to indicate all events without explicitly writing them.
- optional
    - options - a hash of optional data that will be passed on during handler's construction. Please
    note that the handler's class needs to know how to treat these otherwise it's a no-op. For
    example, `Emory::Handlers::StdoutHandler` does not know how to deal with the options so it would
    just ignore them.

Some examples of defining handlers

```ruby
require 'emory/handlers/stdout_handler'
require 'some_company/integration/system_x_handler'

handler do
  name :stdout_handler
  implementation Emory::Handlers::StdoutHandler
  events :added, :removed
end

handler do
  name :integration_handler
  implementation SomeCompany::Integration::SystemXHandler
  events :modified
  options host: 'host1.othercompany.com', port: 12345, username: 'bozo', password: 'p@ssw0rd'
  # or the arrows syntax in Ruby 1.8
  # options :host => 'host1.othercompany.com', :port => 12345, :username => 'bozo', :password => 'p@ssw0rd'
end
```

<a name="emory-dsl-teleport" />
### teleport

A teleport in Emory is an entity that knows that it needs to monitor some path (including sub-directories)
and notify the linked handler if something interesting happens. A teleport can be configured with
2 mandatory and 2 optional parameters:

- mandatory
    - path - the path to monitor (including its sub-directories). Can be either absolute or relative
    to the location of the configuration file (`.emory`).
    - handler - the handler to invoke/notify when the filesystem events occur in the path supplied above
- optional
    - ignore - the regex patterns that need to be ignored by the teleport
    - filter - the regex patterns that filter out unwanted monitoring events

An example teleport definition:

```ruby
# Will monitor file system events starting under <config_location>/ftp/incoming/x/ directory,
# but will ignore paths containing reconciled/ and pending/ directories, and additionaly will
# apply only to .txt files. Once events are identified will notify the handler named :integration_handler.
teleport do
  path 'ftp/incoming/x'
  handler :integration_handler
  ignore %r{reconciled/ pending/}
  filter /\.txt$/
end
```
