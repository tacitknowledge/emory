Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'emory'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install emory
```

<a name="usage" />
Usage
-----

Emory is run from the command line. Please open your terminal and go to your project's work directory.

There you would need to create Emory config file `.emory` which in fact is nothing more than regular
Ruby code wrapped in gem's configuration DSL.

Example configuration:

```ruby
require 'emory/handlers/stdout_handler'

handler :simple, ::Emory::Handlers::StdoutHandler, actions: [:added, :removed]

teleport ['/path/to/watched/directory', '/path/to/another/watched/directory'], :simple
```

The gem supplies an executable file which scans for the configuration file in current directory
(and up the path if not found), configures itself and launches the process. If you need to terminate
execution then proceed like your operating system allows you to (Ctrl-C, for example).

```bash
$ emory
```

Emory configuration DSL
-----------------------

The Emory configuration DSL is evaluated as plain Ruby, so you can use normal Ruby code in your
`.emory` file. Emory itself provides the following DSL methods that can be used for configuration:
